### Notes: ###

**WiFiSetup**

-Need both USB cables connected + SideSwitch in down position

-For reboot, press and hold the power button for 10 seconds. When lights are off, press again for 5 seconds or until a light flashes.
Then spam the keyboard to run the boot command `run do_ota`

-run configuration_edison --wifi first. No need to connect to a wifi network, however, this step properly setups the wifi direct

-run steps from Chapter 6.3 and Chapter 6.9
